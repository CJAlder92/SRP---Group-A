        <h1>About</h1>
            <p>We have re-run the analysis that <a class="external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4243706/" target="_blank" title="Go to Original Paper">Wang et al, 2014</a> performed to analyse the difference in gene expression when using Rat Genome 4 (RN4) and the more recent Rat Genome 6 (RN6) and against an updated analysis pipeline. </p><hr>
        <h1> Gemfibrozil </h1>
        <p> Gemfibrozil is an oral drug which lowers lipid levels. It is a part of a group of drugs known as fibrates. It interacts with perixisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARalpha) which results in a PPARalpha-mediated stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and increases lipoprotein liapse (LPL) synthesis.<br><a class="external" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/gemfibrozil" target="_blank">[Source: Pubchem.ncbi.nih.gov]</a></p>

        <h2>Original Pipeline</h2>
            <img src="Images/pipeline5.png" alt="Pipleine 5 as illustrated by Wang et al, Supplementary Data 2" title="Pipleine 5 as illustrated by Wang et al, Supplementary Data 2." style="float: centre; max-width:100%; height: auto;">
            <p>We have analysed Wang et al's Pipeline 5 with the RN4 and RN6. They used TopHat with Bowtie to align the sequences from the Rat livers to Rat Genome 4 from RefSeq. Then Cufflinks was used to assemble the transcripts. Cufflinks was initially run without an annotation genome to find any novel transcripts, then cuffmerge to create a large merged assembly. This merged assembly was then used as the reference genome to estimate isoform and gene- level expression values as Fragments per Kilobase per Million reads (FKPM) normalized.</p>

        <h2>Updated Pipeline</h2>
            <img src="Images/updated_pipeline_fig.jpg" alt="Updated Pipeline" title="Updated Pipeline" style="float:centre; max-width:100%; height: auto;">
            <p>We then ran a more updated pipeline based on <a class="external" href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.095" title="Pertea et al. 2018." target="_blank">Pertea et al, 2018</a> using Hisat2 with Stringtie to align, assemble, and estimate abundances for, the sequences from the Rat livers to RN4 and RN6 from RefSeq. The samples â€“ paired end reads were taken by Hisat2 (grey) and mapped to a pre-built index of the RN4 and RN6 genomes. StringTie (green) was then used for assembly with the aid of a RefSeq annotation. Assembled reads were merged and used as a guide for StringTie -eB to calculate abundance estimation. This results were stored in a .gtf annotation file. This gave values for transcript expression levels in FKPM and TPM (Transcripts Per Million).</p>
